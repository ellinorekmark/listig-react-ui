# Frontend Web app for List

Communicates with and relies on [https://github.com/ellinorekmark/list](https://github.com/ellinorekmark/list) to work.

Made with Javascript, React & Material UI.

I am not a graphic designer, not even a web developer. I created this frontend app to work with my backend one, and I chose to write it with Javascript and React to try out new technology and progress my learning.
